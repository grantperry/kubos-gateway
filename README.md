# KubOS Python Gateway for Major Tom

*Note:* The gateway is currently in Beta, and is not well documented.
Please [submit an issue](https://github.com/kubos/kubos-gateway/issues/new) or
[come talk to us on Slack](https://slack.kubos.com) if you have any problems!

# First Time Setup

### Check Python Compatibility
The KubOS gateway requires Python 3.7+.
You can check your current version of Python by running:
`python --version` or `python3 --version` depending on your environment.
Whichever command (`python` or `python3`) results in a version that complies will be what you use for the rest of the command line instructions.
We will be using `python3` in the examples.

### Setup Python Virtualenv
Assuming you have the Gateway files on your machine, you'll need to run the following commands from the base folder of the Gateway:

```shell
sudo apt-get install python3-venv
pip3 install virtualenv
python3 -m venv virtualenv
source virtualenv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

*Note:* deactivate the virtualenv by running:
```shell
deactivate
```

### Setup Gateway Config File
Copy the contents of the `gateway_config.toml` into a new file titled `gateway_config.local.toml` for local config
and then update the file to match your system settings.
Here are the required config fields and their description:

- `satellite.name` name of the satellite in Major Tom
- `satellite.ip` overrides the IP address in the KubOS config toml, and can be one of the following:
  - The IP of device on your network running KubOS
  - Localhost for your machine if you're running services locally
  - The IP of the ground communications services tunneling IP to the spacecraft running KubOS
- `satellite.config-path` is the *local* path to the KubOS config `toml` matching the KubOS system you are attempting to communicate with.
  - To retrieve from the spacecraft, it is typically located at: `/etc/kubos-config.toml`
  - You can also use the [example in the kubos repo](https://github.com/kubos/kubos/blob/master/tools/local_config.toml), located at: `$kubos-repo/tools/local_config.toml`

### Retrieve Major Tom Connection Info
We highly recommend running the gateway (`run.py` file) with the `-h` flag to see what all command line options are available:
```shell
source virtualenv/bin/activate
python3 run.py -h
```
Most users will only need the Major Tom Hostname and Gateway Authentication Token.
The Major Tom Hostname is the URL or IP you enter to access Major Tom (eg: app.majortom.cloud).
The Gateway Authentication Token is found by logging in to Major Tom and opening the page of the Gateway you wish to connect to:

![Gateway Page](doc-images/gateway_page.png "Gateway Page in Major Tom")

Retrieve these from your instance of Major Tom.
If your deployment of Major Tom requires a BasicAuth login before your user login,
you'll also need to provide those credentials to the gateway with the `-b` optional argument.

# Running the Gateway
To run the Gateway, execute these commands,
replacing `{MAJOR TOM HOSTNAME}` and `{GATEWAY TOKEN}` as appropriate:

```shell
source virtualenv/bin/activate
python3 run.py {MAJOR TOM HOSTNAME} {GATEWAY TOKEN}
```

Example usage:

```shell
python3 run.py app.majortom.cloud 16b9c3e2cb4b9faf3s252aa402985f5d2471f70304ada3efd673b411d1b7afes
```

After running the gateway, you can deactivate the virtualenv by running:
```shell
deactivate
```
